House price prediction using TensorFlow typically involves building a machine learning model that can learn patterns and relationships in a dataset containing features related to houses (such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and their corresponding prices. TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning library, and it's often used for building and training neuralÂ networks.
